We are pleased to introduce the official Seerr blog.

This space will serve as the central place for:

- Release announcements
- Updates on new features and improvements
- Technical articles, such as details on our [**DNS caching package**](https://github.com/seerr/dns-caching) and other enhancements
- Community-related news

<!--truncate-->

Our goal is to keep the community informed and provide deeper insights into the ongoing development of Seerr.

Thank you for being part of the Seerr project. More updates will follow soon.
