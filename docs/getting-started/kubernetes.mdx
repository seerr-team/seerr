:::info
All official Seerr charts are cryptographically signed and include a verified [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://cyclonedx.org/).

To confirm that the chart you are using is authentic and unmodified, please refer to the [Verifying Signed Artifacts](/using-jellyseerr/advanced/verifying-signed-artifacts#verifying-signed-helm-charts) guide.
:::

## Installation
```console
helm install seerr oci://ghcr.io/seerr-team/seerr/seerr-chart
```
Helm values can be found in the Jellyseerr repository under [charts/jellyseerr-chart/README.md](https://github.com/fallenbagel/jellyseerr/tree/develop/charts/jellyseerr-chart).

Verify the signature with [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/) (replace [tag], with the TAG you want to verify) :
```console
cosign verify ghcr.io/seerr-team/seerr/seerr-chart:[tag] --certificate-identity=https://github.com/fallenbagel/jellyseerr/.github/workflows/helm.yml@refs/heads/main --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.ac
