# Unraid

:::warning
Third-party installation methods are maintained by the community. The Seerr team is not responsible for these packages.
:::

:::warning
This manual method is not recommended for most users. It is intended for advanced users who are using Unraid.
:::

Several templates from Unraid Coommunity are available right now
- [Unraid Community Apps](https://unraid.net/community/apps#community-apps-iframe)

In case you still want to do it manually, please follow the instructions below.

## Fresh Installation

### 1. Create the config directory

:::note
Seerr is now rootless. Unraid typically runs Docker containers as `nobody:users` (UID 99, GID 100), but Seerr now runs internally as UID 1000, GID 1000. This creates a permission mismatch.
:::

:::info
**If migrating**: Copy your existing Jellyseerr/Overseerr config files (e.g., from `/mnt/user/appdata/overseerr/` or `/mnt/user/appdata/jellyseerr`) to `/mnt/user/appdata/seerr`, then apply the permissions below
:::

Open the Unraid terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/user/appdata/seerr
```

You have two options to avoid permission issues caused by Unraid running containers as `nobody:users` (UID 99, GID 100) while Seerr runs internally as UID 1000, GID 1000:

- Recommended: change ownership of the config folder on the host so Seerr runs with its native UID/GID:

  ```bash
  chown -R 1000:1000 /mnt/user/appdata/seerr
  ```

- Alternative:

  ```bash
  chown -R 99:100 /mnt/user/appdata/seerr
  ```

  Explaination : Do not change host ownership and instead run the container as Unraid's `nobody:users` by adding the extra Docker parameter `--user 99:100` when creating the container. This runs the container process with Unraid's default UID/GID and avoids permission errors accessing your shares.

:::warning
Do not use both approaches at the same time, either change the host folder ownership to `1000:1000` or run the container with `--user 99:100`. Mixing both can create confusing ownership and permission states.
:::
### 2. Add the Docker container

Navigate to the **Docker** tab in Unraid and click **Add Container**. Fill in the following:

| Field | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | `seerr` ||
| **Repository** | `ghcr.io/seerr-team/seerr:latest` ||
| **Registry URL** (optional) | `https://ghcr.io` ||
| **Icon URL** | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seerr-team/seerr/develop/public/android-chrome-512x512.png` ||
| **WebUI** | `http://[IP]:[PORT:5055]` ||
| **Extra Parameters** | `--init` | `--init --user 99:100` for the alternative approach |
| **Network Type** | `bridge` ||
| **Privileged** | `Off` ||

Then click **Add another Path, Port, Variable** to add:

**Port:**
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Container Port | `5055` |
| Host Port | `5055` |
| Connection Type | `TCP` |

**Path:**
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Container Path | `/app/config` |
| Host Path | `/mnt/user/appdata/seerr` |

**Variable:**
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Key | `TZ` |
| Value | Your [TZ database name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) (e.g., `America/New_York`) |

**Variable (optional):**
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Key | `LOG_LEVEL` |
| Value | `info` |

Click **Apply** to create and start the container.

### 3. Access Seerr

Open the WebUI at `http://<your-unraid-ip>:5055` and follow the setup wizard.

:::info
The `--init` flag in **Extra Parameters** is required. Seerr does not include its own init process, so `--init` ensures proper signal handling and clean container shutdowns.
