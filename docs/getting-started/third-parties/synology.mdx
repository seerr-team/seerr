Third-party installation methods are maintained by the community. The Seerr team is not responsible for these packages.
:::

:::warning
This method is not recommended for most users. It is intended for advanced users who are using Synology NAS.
:::

## Prerequisites

- Synology NAS running **DSM 7.2** or later
- 64-bit architecture (x86_64 or ARMv8)
- [SynoCommunity package source](https://synocommunity.com/) added to Package Center

## Adding the SynoCommunity Package Source

If you haven't already added SynoCommunity to your Package Center:

1. Open **Package Center** in DSM
2. Click **Settings** in the top-right corner
3. Go to the **Package Sources** tab
4. Click **Add**
5. Enter the following:
   - **Name**: `SynoCommunity`
   - **Location**: `https://packages.synocommunity.com`
6. Click **OK**

## Installation

1. In **Package Center**, search for **Seerr**
2. Click **Install**
3. Follow the installation wizard prompts
4. Package Center will automatically install any required dependencies (Node.js v22)

### Access Seerr

Once installed, access Seerr at:

```
http://<your-synology-ip>:5055
```

You can also click the **Open** button in Package Center or find Seerr in the DSM main menu.

## Configuration

Seerr's configuration files are stored at:

```
/var/packages/seerr/var/config
```

:::info
The Seerr package runs as a dedicated service user managed by DSM. No manual permission configuration is required.
:::

## Managing the Service

You can start, stop, and restart Seerr from **Package Center** → Find Seerr → Use the action buttons.

## Updating

When a new version is available:

1. Open **Package Center**
2. Go to **Installed** packages
3. Find **Seerr** and click **Update** if available

:::tip
Enable automatic updates in Package Center settings to keep Seerr up to date.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Viewing Logs

Seerr logs are located at `/var/packages/seerr/var/config/logs` and can be accessed using:

- **File Browser** package (recommended for most users)
- SSH (advanced users)

### Port Conflicts

Seerr uses port 5055. If this port is already in use by another application, you will need to identify and remove the conflicting service before Seerr can start.

### Package Won't Start

Ensure Node.js v22 is installed and running by checking its status in **Package Center**.

## Uninstallation

1. Open **Package Center**
2. Find **Seerr** in your installed packages
3. Click **Uninstall**

:::caution
Uninstalling will remove the application but preserve your configuration data by default. Select "Remove data" during uninstallation if you want a complete removal.
