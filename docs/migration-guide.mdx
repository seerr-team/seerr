title: Migration guide

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Whether you come from Overseerr or Jellyseerr, you don't need to perform any manual migration steps, your instance will automatically be migrated to Seerr.
An additional migration will happen for Overseerr users, to migrate their configuration to the new codebase.

:::warning
Before doing anything you should backup your existing instance so that you can rollback in case something goes wrong.
See [Backups](/using-jellyseerr/backups) for details on how to properly backup your instance.
:::

## Docker
Refer to [Seerr Docker Documentation](/getting-started/docker), all of our example have been updated to reflect the below change.

Down your compose stack
```bash
docker compose down
```
Copy paste the new compose file (don't forget to update the volume path in the new compose file).
Then, restart all services defined in the Compose file:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Kubernetes
Refer to [Seerr Kubernetes Documentation](/getting-started/kubernetes), all of our example have been updated to reflect the below change.

As our container image can be run without root permission we have updated the default `securityContext` and `podSecurityContext` to match this.
Every reference to jellyseerr has been renamed to seerr in manifests.
