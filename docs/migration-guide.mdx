title: Migration guide

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

This documentation is for users who want to migrate their existing Overseerr or Jellyseerr instance to Seerr.
Jellyseerr serves as the codebase for Seerr, but Overseerr users do not need to perform any manual migration steps.
When you start your Seerr instance, a script automatically detects if your instance is from Overseerr and handles the database migration.

:::warning
Before doing anything you should backup your existing instance so that you can rollback in case something goes wrong.
See [Configuring Databases](/using-jellyseerr/backups) for details on how to properly backup your instance.

## Docker
Refer to [Seerr Docker Documentation](/getting-started/docker), all of our example have been updated to reflect the below change.

Down your compose stack
```bash
docker compose down
```
Copy paste the new compose file (don't forget to update the volume path in the new compose file).
Then, restart all services defined in the Compose file:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Kubernetes
Refer to [Seerr Kubernetes Documentation](/getting-started/kubernetes), all of our example have been updated to reflect the below change.

As our container image can be run without root permission we have updated the default `securityContext` and `podSecurityContext` to match this.
Every reference to jellyseerr has been renamed to seerr in manifests.
